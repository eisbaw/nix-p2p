## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Implement the cornerstone decentralized exact-key discovery core now. Build a bounded Kademlia-style overlay carried over an explicit Iroh ALPN on the shared TASK-115 endpoint. The domain-separated NAR content key resolves to signed provider records containing Iroh NodeIds and bounded transport offers but no dialable addresses. Multiple configurable bootstrap NodeIds are allowed but no tracker registry server or single operator is required. This task owns the protocol codec routing record store and multi-node core proof; TASK-103 later wires it behind ContentDiscovery and TASK-102 gates real daemon publication.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Freeze versioned domain-separated NarHash-to-DHT-key and provider-record codecs with golden cross-version and one-byte namespace mutation vectors.
- [ ] #2 Provider records are signed by the provider Iroh identity and contain exact content key provider NodeId bounded transport offers sequence issued-at and expiry but no IP port relay address StorePath or unasked key.
- [ ] #3 Enforce monotonic provider sequence idempotent refresh explicit signed withdrawal expiry replay rejection concurrent-provider merge and no expired-record resurrection.
- [ ] #4 Requests responses provider counts record bytes routing buckets concurrency work amplification and deadlines are bounded and malformed bad-signature wrong-key unknown-version stale and oversized messages fail closed.
- [ ] #5 SPIKE GATE (first): decide the ProviderDirectory backend with evidence, not faith. Confirm the substrate can store an OPAQUE signed value (our ContentKey -> signed ProviderRecord bytes) so the frozen codec does NOT leak into the substrate's own record wire; if iroh-dht-experiment exposes only its typed records, libp2p-kad put_record/get_record becomes the freeze target and primary/fallback flips. Primary iroh-dht-experiment / fallback libp2p-kad; the in-progress hand-rolled Kademlia is salvaged as a FakeProviderDirectory in-memory test oracle, not shipped infra.

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
DEEP gate (Workflow wiba389dr) = NO_GO via cross-model codex (qa+mped were GO). Round-2 fixes required before this irreversible freeze counts. Freeze-blocking: (1) pin ed25519 canonicality policy + add malleable S+L negative vector; (2) canonicalize offer ordering (or explicitly pin order-significant + reject dup tags); (3) resolve provider-vs-offer-locator identity (require iroh offer node==provider, or document delegation; validate offer node is a valid point); (6) replace debug_assert! in provide_body with a real fail-closed check (release must not sign over-cap/>255 offers). Proof-hardening: (4) python anchor must reject unknown infohash versions {only 1,2}, parse no_offers, add a rejection vector; (5) golden rejection tests must assert the SPECIFIC typed error (not just is_err) with each vector's ONLY fault being the guard under test + a positive BitTorrent-v1 vector + BadInfoHash bite. Fixing #2/#3 may change frozen bytes/goldens - that is correct NOW (nothing consumes them; freeze is v1 pre-adoption).
